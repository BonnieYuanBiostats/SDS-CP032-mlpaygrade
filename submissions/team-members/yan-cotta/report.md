## 6. Feature Engineering Strategy

### 6.1 Job Title Consolidation (155 → 6 categories)
```python
consolidation_strategy = {
    'DATA_SCIENCE': ['Data Scientist', 'Research Scientist', 'Applied Scientist'],
    'DATA_ENGINEERING': ['Data Engineer', 'Analytics Engineer', 'ML Engineer'],
    'DATA_ANALYSIS': ['Data Analyst', 'Business Intelligence Analyst'],
    'MACHINE_LEARNING': ['Machine Learning Engineer', 'Machine Learning Scientist'],
    'MANAGEMENT': ['Data Manager', 'Head of Data', 'Director of Data Science'],
    'SPECIALIZED': [remaining_rare_titles]
}
```

### 6.2 Geographic Hierarchy (77 → 8 categories)
```python
geographic_strategy = {
    'continent': ['NORTH_AMERICA', 'EUROPE', 'ASIA_PACIFIC', 'OTHER'],
    'economic_tier': ['HIGH_INCOME', 'DEVELOPED', 'EMERGING', 'OTHER']
}
```

### 6.3 Experience-Company Interaction Features
```python
interaction_features = {
    'career_stage': f"{experience_level}_{company_size}",
    'seniority_score': encoded_experience * company_size_weight
}
```

### 6.4 Target Variable Transformation
